UML Guidelines
Include UML version on diagram
Include a header(name / class/ assignment #)
You may omit a simple driver class if doesnâ€™t include any real design functionality.
Public static void main(String[] args) {
App myApp = new App();
    myApp.run();
}
If this class contains other attributes or methods it should be included.
    Getters / setters / constructors may be omitted to save space
Getters / setters should directly match the associated attribute
int attr => setAttr / getAttr
As an industry best practice, most attributes should be private or protected and not public access.
Your diagram should be able to fit on one page of a pdf, they can be as large as necessary.
Ensure diagram is clear when zooming in if it is large
Relationship lines should be clear.Avoid curved lines.Minimize crossing other relationships and cutting through other classes as much as reasonably possible.
If this becomes hard it may indicate a need to refactor your design.
Access specifiers are not included in lecture videos but they should match your code
public: +
    private: -
        protected: #
Class names should begin with capital letters and contain no spaces
ClassName not Class Name
Attributes and methods should not begin with capital letters and contain no spaces
Use camel case (newAttr) or underscores(new_attr)
Return types and parameters for methods should be included, variable names can be omitted to save space.If no return type is listed it is assumed to be void.
+ setAttr(int) or + setAttr(attr: int)
    + getAttr() : int
Cardinalities should appear on both ends of all relationship(s)
Class and attribute names should be singular.
Names of Collections can be plural, include the types in your diagram.
- courses: Set
    - heights: int[]
Constants should be capitalized
SOME_CONSTANT
Include types for lists, arrays, sets, etc.
    Attributes / operations should not be on the relationship line or inferred by the relationship
They should be listed inside the class model box in the appropriate section.
This guidance overrides what is generally considered normal & acceptably by Larman & will be unacceptable for this class.
Tools that generate UML diagrams from existing code violate the spirit of the assignments and are not permitted.
No hand drawn diagrams.
